//! CPU Capabilities Detection Module
//!
//! This module provides architecture-specific detection and utilization of CPU features
//! for optimized cryptographic operations. It conditionally compiles and re-exports
//! submodules based on the target architecture, allowing the rest of the crate to use
//! the most efficient implementation available for the current platform.
//!
//! # Supported Architectures
//! - x86, x86_64: Uses the `x86` submodule for Intel/AMD CPUs.
//! - arm, aarch64: Uses the `arm` submodule for ARM CPUs.
//! - mips, mips32r6, mips64, mips64r6: Uses the `mips` submodule for MIPS CPUs.
//! - Others: Uses the `fallback` submodule as a generic implementation.
